Checklist of stuff to do:
-Add x next to each link so user can personally delete it without having to open that link first
-Implement buttons to allow users to also save all tabs within the current window or all tabs within the current session
-Improve UI
-Add personal extension icon
-Add a confirmation for clearing all saved tabs. Alerts don't work in Chrome extensions.
-When there are too many tabs, need to find a way to collapse and display them conveniently
