Checklist of stuff to do:
-Button in middle of tabsview to open all tabs
-For each box_elemnt, use GetElementsByClassName instead of GetElementById
-Auto-reload tabsview after deleting one element
-Open all tabs in either current window or new window
-Change tabsview style to list more tabs at once
-Allow highlighting of tabs so that user can open the highlighted tabs together


BUGS:
-clicking x or new tab will sometimes delete entire storage (may be do to splicing a specific index)
-When have 9 elements and delete one, can still go to the next page and the next page is blank
