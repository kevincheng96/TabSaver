Checklist of stuff to do:
-Add x next to each link so user can personally delete it without having to open that link first
-Implement buttons to allow users to also save all tabs within the current window or all tabs within the current session
-Improve UI
-Add a confirmation for clearing all saved tabs. Alerts don't work in Chrome extensions.
-When there are too many tabs, need to find a way to collapse and display them conveniently

UI MASTER GOAL FOR TABLIST:
-Have maybe 9 squares, each a link, with url icon in the middle of the square and short-url below the icon. Then have an arrow button that allows user to click and view more saved tabs until no tabs are left. (sort of like Safari's bookmarks)
-Icons are currently not showing up if they were not saved individually. This problem may be due to no permission from extension to access remote imgs that are not from the current tab... Look into how to grab stuff from other websites in an extension


BUGS:
-Save buttons are not changing text when clicked
-Need to re-implement deleting a tab when clicked
-Changing saved tab pages with current_index is buggy (re-check to see if index values are iterated correctly)
