Checklist of stuff to do:
-Add a confirmation for clearing all saved tabs. Alerts don't work in Chrome extensions.
-Button in middle of tabsview to open all tabs
-For each box_elemnt, use GetElementsByClassName instead of GetElementById
-Auto-reload tabsview after deleting one element


BUGS:
-Clicking box element sometimes does not take me to new link
-When have 10 elements, and delete on from the first page, and then visit the second page, the second page will have no elements and cannot return to the first page
